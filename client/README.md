API Client Demo
===============
This is a desktop client I wrote to demostrate the usages of API, consists of a .Net library and graphical user interface.  
The library is ready to consume, can be load and integrate into third-party projects.

I used it as acceptance testing tool and demonstrating API usages during my presentation session.
