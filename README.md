TextFarm Web Services
=====================

This is my personal graduate project, a REST-style Web API provider.


### Further details
======
The full documentation will not be publish.  
Project interpretion and the API Guidelines is accessible on */server/index.html*.


### Note to Self
======
As a newbie to PHP, there are couples of design oversight against on php.

Some issues were revealed during development phase.  
The emerged issues were mostly due to PHP attributes and ways of handling  
class and files(code it self), make me harder to honor the original flows.

In my case standard UML diagrams are a *must* do, it is not wise to alter the  
design even so they wasn't really suiting against PHP. It will only result  
some valid but scattering elements in result wasted the purpose of UML.

Placed under the circumstance, this represent a no-brainer decision for me.  
I sticked closest possible to the design avoid parting away from original  
design document. After all these were architectural problems, some additional  
codes can compensate it.

The Web API outward appearance is fully reflecting to its design and  
the API endpoints are functioning as expected. The final result sacrificed  
not a single features, just some ghost flows added among codes.
